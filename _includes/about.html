              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <br/>
                <p>I completed my undergraduate studies in Physics at <a href="http://physics.illinois.edu/">the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a> before joining the extragalactic research group at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests include cosmological model selection, near-field cosmology, galaxy formation & evolution, and big data & statistics.
                <p>In my free time I hike & collect bugs, sew/craft all sorts of things, and cuddle my goofy rescue dog. I also work with <a href="http://www.bigmentoring.org/site/c.bkLVKdOQLjK6E/b.6458477/k.635/Big_Brothers_Big_Sisters_of_Central_Texas.htm">Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Texas</a></p>.
